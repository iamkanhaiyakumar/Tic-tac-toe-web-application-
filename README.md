# Tic-tac-toe-web-application-


The tic-tac-toe web application is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game board is represented as a two-dimensional array, and the current player is kept track of using a variable. Event listeners are used to detect when a player clicks on a square on the game board. When a player clicks on a square, the game logic is executed to check for a win or a draw.
